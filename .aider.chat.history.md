I need to edit the app metadata file to update the title and description.  
Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact changes.

A stylized map image representing whale distribution across blockchains, featuring a whale silhouette over a world map background. The design uses a blue and green color palette with subtle gradients and a gentle glow effect to convey depth and movement. The background shows faint grid lines and continents, while the whale is centered and slightly larger, symbolizing influence. The overall look is clean, modern, and suitable for a crypto analytics dashboard.
